# Event-Driven Ansible Lab

This is a lab designed to demonstrate Ansible and how Event-Driven Ansible (**EDA**) builds on top of its capabilities.

The setup is done with Ansible, too. It will install **Ansible, EDA, Prometheus**, and **Alertmanager** on a VM to demonstrate some of the capabilities of EDA.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this lab in its entirety, you will need three VMs:

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to skip Ansible basics and go straight to EDA, you'll need just the `eda-controller.example.com` VM and can skip the others.

| VM name            | OS          |
|--------------------|-------------|
| eda-controller.example.com | CentOS/Rocky 8.9 |
| company.example.com        | CentOS/Rocky 8.9 |
| webshop.example.com       | Ubuntu 22.04     |

**You'll need to be able to SSH to each of these VMs as root using SSH keys.**

## Lab Setup

### Clone the repository and create a Python virtual environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mocdaniel/lab-event-driven-ansible.git
cd lab-event-driven-ansible
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Install Ansible and other dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Create the inventory file

```yaml
---
# hosts.yml
webservers:
  hosts:
    webshop.example.com:
      ansible_host: <ip-address>
      webserver: apache2
    company.example.com:
      ansible_host: <ip-address>
      webserver: httpd
eda_controller:
  hosts:
    eda-controller.example.com:
      ansible_host: <ip-address>
```

### Install Needed Roles and Collections
    
```bash
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
```

### Run the Setup Playbook

After you created the inventory file and filled in the IP addresses, you can run the setup playbook:

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/setup.yml
```

> [!CAUTION]
> Due to a known bug with Python on MacOS, you need to run `export NO_PROXY="*"` on MacOS before running the playbook

## Demos

### Lab 1: Ansible Basics

<details>

<summary>Ansible from the CLI via ansible</summary>

#### Ansible from the CLI via `ansible`

The first example installs a webserver on all hosts in the `webservers` group. The installed webserver is defined as a **host variable** in the inventory file `hosts.yml` (*see above*).

```console
ansible \
   webservers  \
  -m package   \
  -a 'name="{{ webserver }}"' \
  --one-line
```

Afterwards, we can start the webserver on all hosts in the `webservers` group.

```console
ansible \
   webservers  \
  -m service   \
  -a 'name="{{ webserver }}" state=started' \
  --one-line
```

Go on and check if the web servers are running on the respective hosts.

> [!TIP]
> Ansible is **idempotent** - try running the commands again and see how the output differs.

<summary>Ansible from the CLI via ansible-playbook</summary>

#### Ansible from the CLI via `ansible-playbook`

The second example utilizes the following **playbook** to **gather** and **display information** for all hosts in the `webservers` group, utilizing the **example** role from the lab repository.

```yaml
---
- name: Example role
  hosts: webservers
  gather_facts: false
  vars:
    greeting: "Hello World!"
  pre_tasks:
    - name: Say Hello
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        msg: "{{ greeting }}"
  roles:
    - role: example
  post_tasks:
    - name: Say goodbye
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        msg: Goodbye!
```

```console
ansible-playbook \
    playbooks/example.yml
```
